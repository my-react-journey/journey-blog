This is the first blog in the **My React Journey** series. 🚄

I will be blogging about the **concepts**, **tools**, **techniques** and **projects** that I learn, find or build during this journey.

I will host all my projects on Netlify 💠 to enhance my feedback cycle.

This blog stops once I get a job 👷‍♂️ where I can work with React.

Not sure whether I will be able to do this yet, 😗 but I will be posting more frequently as I learn more. 🤠

Really excited to learn React ⚛.

Thanks for reading! 🤝
