I got inspired by this Instagram post by @abhishvek: [Flutter Password Checker](https://www.instagram.com/p/CghOpW9D-2p/) and though Mmm, maybe I can do something similar with React.

I created a new project. Created the password checker component. Stole some good old regex from this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21456918) and [iHateRegex](https://ihateregex.io/)

Added the Google Sans Medium WOFF2 Font (not commercial) to the project. Looks kinda nice.

Thought of adding a service worker to make it work offline, but right now, I don't know how to do that. Maybe I'll come back to this later.

[Check it out](https://checkmypassword.netlify.app/). Source code on [Github](https://github.com/my-react-journey/password-check)

Also, in the [organization page](https://github.com/my-react-journey) on GitHub, I'm gonna pin 
- The blog
- My first React project
- My Recent React Project and
- The best project I've ever created (in my opinion)
